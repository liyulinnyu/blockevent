# BlockEvent

BlockEvent is not just a simple event management, but a special one. You can see and manage the whole year schedule planning in BlockEvent, and just in one page! It's totally different from other event managements. If you want your schedule looks more clearly, and record all the happy and upset things of the whole year, just use it!   

## What's different?

In my opinion, at least four points:
1. BlockEvent makes your schedule simple and clear. Other daily event managements are too complex, if you are not a trouble maker, most of the features you don't need them at all! 
2. BlockEvent is a good recorder. You can see the whole year schedule at one page! All the happy things, all the upset things, just use a screen cut and share with your friends!
3. BlockEvent can distinguish the things by their importance. For example, you can use orange color to mark a block which contains some happy things, and use the blue color to represent the upset things, anyway, do what you like!
4. BlockEvent is a good searcher. You can find a certain thing or a certain date by using search button, if found, the certain block will flashing three times to remind you. What's more, you can also search a whole month, just try it!
