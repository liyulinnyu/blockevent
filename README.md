# BlockEvent

BlockEvent is not just a simple event management, but a special one. You can see and manage the whole year schedule planning in BlockEvent, and just in one page! It's totally different from other event managements. If you want your schedule looks more clearly, and record all the happy and upset things of the whole year, just use it!   

## What's different?

In my opinion, at least four points:
1. BlockEvent makes your schedule simple and clear. Other daily event managements are too complex, if you are not a trouble maker, most of the features you don't need them at all! 
2. BlockEvent is a good recorder. You can see the whole year schedule at one page! All the happy things, all the upset things, just use a screen cut and share with your friends!
3. BlockEvent can distinguish the things by their importance. For example, you can use orange color to mark a block which contains some happy things, and use the blue color to represent the upset things, anyway, do what you like!
4. BlockEvent is a good searcher. You can find a certain thing or a certain date by using search button, if found, the certain block will flashing three times to remind you. What's more, you can also search a whole month, just try it! 

## How to use?

### Main page

If you login, you can see the main page as below. It contains following elements:
1. Show your name.
2. Time and event search input button.
3. Show the year. (I will update its soon so that you can find every year's events)
4. Month select button.
5. Log out button.
6. The whole year event blocks. (2017 has 365 blocks)
7. If a block has contents, it will show the different color that you have given it when you created it. For me, you can see I have a orange block, because I have recorded a event in that day.

### Find event

As for finding events, you have three choice. 
1. Select a certain month by using the month selector. For example, I want to select the first month, the page will show like below:

2. Select a certain event by using Event search button. If the event has been found, the block will flash three times to remind you. If there are more than one block contain this event, they will flash at the same time.
(Because the flashing effect cannot be showed in picture, so I don't push image here, you can try it in your own BlockEvent)

3. Select a certain day by using Time search button. If the day has been found, the block will flash three times to remind you.
(Because the flashing effect cannot be showed in picture, so I don't push image here, you can try it in your own BlockEvent)


### Update event

Just click the block which you want to update the information, it will show the old contents, what you need to do is just like create event.


### Delete event

Select the block which you want to delete the information. And just click the delete button. For example, I delete the orange event, the picture will like below.

### Other things

1. You can see all the past day block without any events will show the deep gray color, today and all the future day block without any events will show the light gray.

2. You can put your mouse on the block, it will show the date. And you can also click it to see the date.

3. You'd better to use this website in PC end. Even though I have done the adaptation of mobile end, because the purpose is to show the whole year's events, it will have a better visual effect in PC end.
